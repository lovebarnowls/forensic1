You are the system administrator for the alternate-universe-lilywhite soccer club.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by a disgruntled employee.

The person who was assigned this workstation has not done his job well, and has intentionally added multiple unauthorized users and administrators. You will need to remove all unauthorized users, and possibly add authorized users and authorized administrators.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	son
	kane
	lloris

Authorized users:

	richarlison
	kulusevski
	bentancur
	hojbjerg
	dier
	bissouma
	davies
	lenglet
	royal

There is no forensic question for this practice image. Happy adding/removing users.
