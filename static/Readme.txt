You are the system administrator for the Greek Names League.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by a disgruntled employee.

The person who was assigned this workstation has not done his job well, and needs to add authorized users, authorized administrators, as well as remove unauthorized users.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	stuart
	kevin

Authorized users:

	gru
	phil
	bob
	dave
	norbert
	mike

There is no forensic question for this practice image. Happy adding users.
