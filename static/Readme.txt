You are the system administrator for the fans-of-microsoft club.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by a disgruntled employee.

The person who was assigned this workstation has not done his job well, and has intentionally added multiple unauthorized users and administrators. You will need to remove all unauthorized users, and possibly add authorized users and authorized administrators.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	linux
	excel
	powerpoint

Authorized users:

	teams
	outlook
	onenote
	bsod

There is no forensic question for this practice image. Happy adding/removing users.
